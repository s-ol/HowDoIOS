This folder contains the 0x10c DevKit project files for **S0lllOS**.

As of now, you need to manually replace all the `.reserve` statements with `reserve`'s, I added both so you just need to (un)comment.

You also need to comment out the `.include` statements as DevKit automatically includes all the files.
